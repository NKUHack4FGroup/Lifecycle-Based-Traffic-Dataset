# Lifecycle-Based Traffic Collection for Consumer IoT Devices

This repository contains the traffic collection methods and experimental analysis code used in our paper "Security and Privacy Measurement on Chinese Consumer IoT Traffic based on Device Lifecycle" submitted to the journal Science China Information Sciences.

## Directory Structure

Each subfolder includes the complete code and configuration files for the corresponding analysis section:

* `destination_analyse/` — Section 4: Destination Analysis, used to identify and analyze the destinations accessed by device traffic.
* `encryption_analyse/` — Section 5: Encryption Practices Analysis, used to evaluate the use of encryption in network traffic.
* `traffic_collection/` — Traffic Collection Methods, including the setup of the lab network environment and device configuration details.
* `result_demo/` — Sample Traffic and Results, providing lifecycle traffic and measurement results for two example devices for preview.
* `device-list.xlsx/` — Device List.

## Traffic Data Description

From March 1, 2024, to June 16, 2025, we collected approximately 108 hours of network traffic data from 77 consumer-grade IoT devices.

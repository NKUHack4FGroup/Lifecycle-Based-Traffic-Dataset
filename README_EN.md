**Lifecycle-Based Traffic Collection for Consumer IoT Devices**
This repository contains the traffic collection methodology and experimental analysis code used in our paper *"Security and Privacy Measurement on Chinese Consumer IoT Traffic based on Device Lifecycle"*, submitted to *Science China Information Sciences* in March 2025.

**Directory Structure**
Each subfolder includes the complete code and configuration files for the corresponding analysis section:

* `destination_analyse/` — Section 4: Destination Analysis, used to identify and analyze the destinations accessed by device traffic.
* `encryption_analyse/` — Section 5: Encryption Practices Analysis, used to evaluate the use of encryption in network traffic.
* `traffic_collection/` — Traffic Collection Methods, including the setup of the lab network environment and device configuration details.
* `result_demo/` — Sample Traffic and Results, providing lifecycle traffic and measurement results for two example devices for preview.

**Traffic Data Description**
From March 1, 2024, to June 16, 2025, we collected approximately 108 hours of network traffic data from 77 consumer-grade IoT devices.
